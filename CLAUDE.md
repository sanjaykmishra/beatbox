# Beat — project memory for Claude Code

This file is the entry point. Read it fully, then read `docs/` in order. Wireframes are in `assets/`. Prompt sources are in `prompts/`.

## What we're building

**Beat** is an AI-powered coverage report generator for solo and boutique PR teams. The single MVP job: paste a list of press coverage URLs, get back a polished, branded, client-ready PDF report — in under 60 seconds.

**Target user:** boutique PR agency owners (2–10 people) and solo freelance PR pros, currently rebuilding monthly client reports from scratch in PowerPoint and dreading it.

**Why we win:** 10x cheaper than Cision/Muck Rack/Meltwater. Reporting-first, not database-first. LLM-native (better summaries, sentiment, narrative arcs).

**Pricing:** $59/mo solo, $179/mo agency, $349/mo studio. No free tier. 14-day trial. Existing customers grandfathered at $39/$99 for 12 months from price change. See `docs/18-cost-engineering.md` for the cost analysis underpinning these figures.

## Build context

- Bootstrapped, small team. Optimize for shipping the wedge, not building the platform.
- Phase 1 target: first paying customer in 10–12 weeks.
- We are NOT building Cision. We are building the reporting layer that closes a ticket. Saying no to scope is the most important skill on this project.

## Tech stack (decided — don't re-litigate without good reason)

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Backend | Spring Boot 3.x (Java 21) | Team strength is Java |
| DB | Postgres 16 | JSONB + reliability + cheap hosting |
| Queue | Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY for v1; RabbitMQ when we outgrow it | Avoid infra sprawl early |
| Frontend | React 18 + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind | Team strength is JS |
| PDF rendering | Puppeteer microservice (Node) | Best-in-class HTML→PDF; worth the extra service |
| LLM | Anthropic API. Haiku for high-volume mechanical work, Sonnet for judgment, Opus reserved for keystone customer-facing prose. | See `docs/05-llm-prompts.md` and `docs/18-cost-engineering.md` |
| Article fetching | Mercury Parser → Readability → paid scraper API fallback (e.g. ScrapingBee) | Layered for paywalls |
| Auth | Email/password + session cookies (no SSO until enterprise tier) | Boring is fine |
| Billing | Stripe Checkout + Customer Portal | Don't build billing UI |
| Hosting | Fly.io or Railway | One-line deploys, no AWS yet |
| Object storage | Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) | Cheap egress for PDFs |
| Observability | Sentry + Logtail. Postgres slow-query log on. | Enough for v1 |

## Conventions

**Code style.** Java: standard Google Java style, formatted with Spotless on commit. JS/TS: Prettier + ESLint. No bikeshedding.

**Naming.** Tables snake_case plural (`coverage_items`). Java classes PascalCase singular (`CoverageItem`). REST paths kebab-case where multi-word.

**IDs.** All primary keys are UUIDs from `gen_random_uuid()`. No sequential integers exposed in URLs.

**Timestamps.** Every table has `created_at` and `updated_at` (NOT NULL, default `now()`). User-facing entities also have `deleted_at` (NULL = active). Use `timestamptz`, never `timestamp`.

**API errors.** RFC 7807 problem-details. Every response includes a `request_id` header for support.

**UI page chrome.** Every protected route in `web/src/routes/` wraps its content in `BrowserFrame` with a `crumbs` array. Every intermediate crumb has a `to:` field so users can navigate up the hierarchy (e.g. `[{label: '${slug}.beat.app', to: '/clients'}, {label: 'clients', to: '/clients'}, {label: clientName}]`); the final crumb (the current page) has no `to`. The chrome strip is the canonical breadcrumb; do not also render an in-body `<nav>` breadcrumb. Each page's `<h1>` is followed by a one-line muted help subtitle (`<p className="mt-1 text-xs text-gray-500">…</p>`) explaining what the page does and any non-obvious behavior (e.g. "Field changes save automatically when you click away.", "Click any item to edit before generating. Edits stick across re-runs."). Auth pages (`AuthShell`) and the 404 are exempt — they're outside the workspace shell.

**User-visible feedback.** Two primitives:
- **`<Alert tone="danger|warning|success|info" title=… onDismiss=… action=…>`** in `web/src/components/ui.tsx` — banner shape, persistent until dismissed. Use for backend rejections, validation errors, non-blocking concerns (trial ending, grandfathered pricing), and page-level guidance. Anchor it inside the page near the action that produced it.
- **`useToast()` from `web/src/components/Toast.tsx`** — transient confirmations (`toast.success('Saved.')`, `toast.error('Couldn\'t save.')`). Top-right stack, auto-dismisses after ~3.5 seconds (errors get 6s). Mounted once via `<ToastProvider>` at the app root in `main.tsx`.

Never use a bare `<p className="text-red-600">` or similar for user-facing feedback — those are easy to miss, don't dismiss, and don't stack. Pick `Alert` for "this needs attention" and `useToast()` for "this just happened."

**Destructive confirmations.** Use **`useConfirm()` from `web/src/components/ConfirmDialog.tsx`** — never the native `window.confirm()`. The browser default renders unstyled chrome ("localhost:5173 says…") that breaks the product's visual identity. Pattern: `const ok = await confirm({title: 'Delete this post?', body: 'This cannot be undone.', tone: 'danger', confirmLabel: 'Delete post'}); if (!ok) return;`. Provider is mounted once at the app root via `<ConfirmDialogProvider>` in `main.tsx`. Use `tone: 'danger'` for delete/destroy actions; default for benign confirmations.

**Migrations.** Flyway. Numbered files (`V001__init.sql`). Migrations are forward-only; never edit a merged migration.

**Tests.** Unit tests next to code. Integration tests in `src/test/integration/`. The LLM eval harness lives in `src/test/eval/` and runs nightly + on every PR that touches `prompts/` or LLM client code. See `docs/06-evals.md`.

**Secrets.** Never in code. Use `.env` locally, Fly secrets in production. Required env vars are listed in `docs/02-architecture-and-stack.md`.

**Commits.** Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`). One logical change per commit.

## Engineering rules of thumb (lessons learned)

These exist because each one represents a real bug that already shipped. When in doubt, check the named exemplar file before writing new code.

**Mirror existing conventions before writing new infra code.** Before creating a new `*Repository`, `*Controller`, or `*Service`, grep for an analogous one and copy its parameter-binding patterns rather than improvising. `app.beat.report.ReportRepository` and `app.beat.auth.SessionRepository` are the reference implementations for JdbcClient usage.

**Postgres JDBC parameter binding.** Two foot-guns hit us in the same week:
- `java.time.Instant` cannot be passed via `setObject()`. Always wrap with `java.sql.Timestamp.from(instant)` (handle null). See `OwnedPostRepository.ts(Instant)`.
- Inside `COALESCE(:param, column)`, every bound parameter needs an explicit cast — including scalars when the value is null. Use `CAST(:p AS text)`, `CAST(:p AS timestamptz)`, `CAST(:tp AS text[])`, `CAST(:variants AS jsonb)`. Without the cast, Postgres throws "could not determine data type of parameter $N". Pattern reference: `OwnedPostRepository.update`.

**Validation annotations are type-specific.** `@NotBlank` only validates `CharSequence` and throws `UnexpectedTypeException` (→ 500) on `UUID`/numeric types. Use `@NotNull` for non-string required fields.

**Bundled JAR resources need both gradle config AND Dockerfile copy.** `api/build.gradle` bundles `migrations/` and `prompts/` via `processResources { from('../X') }`. The Dockerfile must `COPY` each of those source directories into the build context, or the JAR ships without them and `PromptLoader.get()` / Flyway fail at runtime. Locally everything works because the directories exist on disk. See `infra/api/Dockerfile`.

**Smoke-test LLM calls with a real key before claiming a feature is done.** Prompt frontmatter is opaque — model IDs, temperature, max_tokens — and the only way to catch typos is one real call. Run the endpoint once locally with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set before merging.

**Test the path the SPA actually exercises.** Auto-save-on-blur paths usually patch with mostly-null scalars; happy-path tests usually create with all fields set. They're different SQL paths. Integration tests should mirror the request shape the frontend sends, not just the canonical happy path.

**Surface 5xx errors in logs.** `ProblemDetailHandler` and `RequestLogFilter` log unhandled exceptions and per-request access lines. Don't add a swallow-and-return-500 path that bypasses them — every 5xx should leave a stack trace.

**Cross-layer changes need a touch-point checklist before commit.** Adding a value to a domain enum touches at minimum: (1) the prompt(s) that ask the LLM for it, (2) the Java schema validator that parses LLM output, (3) the controller `@Pattern` validators on PATCH/PUT endpoints, (4) the Postgres `CHECK` constraint on the column, (5) the SPA TypeScript union type, (6) any UI dropdown that lists the values. Lint + tests + tsc passing means the *types* line up; it does not mean the DB or the LLM contract does. Real example: the `subject_prominence = 'missing'` rollout shipped (1)(2)(3)(5)(6) and broke at runtime on (4) when the worker tried to write the new value. Before claiming a schema/enum change is done, grep the old value across `prompts/`, `api/src/main/java/`, `migrations/`, and `web/src/` and verify each hit is updated or intentionally legacy.

**Same idiom in two places means check both when changing one.** Repository-layer COALESCE patterns are the most common offender. `screenshot_url = COALESCE(screenshot_url, :ss)` ("keep old, fall back to new") was wrong for re-extract but right for user-edit-preservation; the same idiom appeared in adjacent fields with the opposite required direction. When touching one COALESCE direction in `applyFetched` (or any repository), audit every COALESCE in the same method and decide each one independently. Pattern reference: `CoverageItemRepository.applyFetched` after V012.

**Visual changes aren't verified until they're loaded in a browser.** Type-check + lint + render-template-compiles is not the same as "this looks right." For SPA changes that affect layout, screen-mode CSS (`@media screen` blocks in `render/templates/`), iframe-embedded HTML, or anything cross-origin (public share, srcDoc), explicitly state in the report-back: "I haven't loaded this in a browser; please verify." Don't paper over the gap by claiming it works when it hasn't been seen.

## Critical guardrails

These exist because failure here is high-cost. Don't relax them without explicit human sign-off.

1. **Never hot-swap a prompt.** Bump the version string (`extraction_v1.3` → `extraction_v1.4`), store the version on the `coverage_items` row, and go through eval review. See `docs/05-llm-prompts.md`.
2. **Never ship if the eval harness is failing.** The pre-launch gate in `docs/06-evals.md` is a hard gate. Hallucination rate must be 0 on the golden set.
3. **Never invent attributions in summaries.** If the LLM returns a quote or fact not in the source article, that's a sev-1 bug. The whole product trades on agency trust.
4. **Cell-level edits always win.** When a user edits an extracted field on a coverage item, that edit is sticky across re-runs. Worker code must respect `is_user_edited` flags.
5. **Reports lock at generation time.** Once a report is finalized, coverage_items are frozen. Re-runs require explicit user action.
6. **Brand-safe by default.** Every PDF carries the agency's branding (their logo, their colors), never Beat's. Beat is invisible to the agency's clients.
7. **Activity events fire on every meaningful action.** When adding new mutations, add the corresponding `activity_events` write. The founder dashboard, customer analytics, and Phase 3+ features depend on this discipline. See `docs/15-additions.md` §15.2.
8. **Social mentions are first-class.** When new features reason about "what's been written about a client," they include both `coverage_items` and `social_mentions`. Don't accidentally regress to article-only logic.
9. **Pitches never auto-send.** Every individual pitch requires a human click. There is no auto-send mode, no scheduled bulk-send, no "approve and forget" workflow. See `docs/12a-phase-3-campaign-workflow.md` for full reasoning. Non-negotiable.
10. **Cost engineering disciplines apply across every AI surface.** Model tiering (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus by signal value), prompt caching, context compression, batching async work, and deterministic pre-filters are not optional optimizations — they're how the cost-to-revenue ratio works. See `docs/18-cost-engineering.md`. Eval gates are non-negotiable; quality preservation gates every cost migration.

## Getting started with Claude Code

The first session should bootstrap the repo. A reasonable starter prompt:

> Read CLAUDE.md and all of docs/ in order. Then read prompts/ and look at the wireframes in assets/. Confirm you understand the scope before writing code. Then bootstrap the repo per docs/02-architecture-and-stack.md and start week 1 of docs/08-build-plan.md.

Subsequent sessions can be scoped to a specific week or feature, e.g.:

> We're on week 4 of docs/08-build-plan.md. Read prompts/extraction-v1.md and docs/05-llm-prompts.md and docs/06-evals.md. Implement the article extraction worker and the golden-set eval harness. Stop after the harness runs green on a 5-article seed set; we'll grow it next session.

## Open decisions (call out before coding)

These are things I haven't fully decided. If you hit one, raise it — don't pick silently.

- **Outlet curation source.** ~500 hand-curated outlets. Where does the seed list come from? Probably scraped from Cision/Muck Rack public lists + manual review.
- **Sentiment model.** Pure LLM, or LLM + a separate FinBERT-style classifier as a sanity check? Starting LLM-only; revisit if eval scores plateau.
- **Reach numbers.** Domain Authority (Moz/Ahrefs) vs. SimilarWeb visit estimates. Need to pick one source and stick with it for consistency. Defaulting to DA via DataForSEO until proven inadequate.
- **Multi-tenant isolation strategy.** Row-level (workspace_id on every table, enforced by app code) for v1. Postgres RLS later if/when enterprise tier demands it. See `docs/14-multi-tenancy.md` for current rules and the pre-flight checklist for new tenant tables.
